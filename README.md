## 🧭 Recommended Learning Path

Follow this order to build knowledge progressively:

1. **Start with basics**:  
   → Read `1.basic/` to understand Python’s built-in functions and data structure features.

2. **Deep dive into data types**:  
   → Study each data structure in `2.explained-pre-build-function/`.

3. **Practice iteration**:  
   → Run and modify the loop examples in `3.loop-in-buld-in-ds/`.

4. **Learn essential utilities**:  
   → Explore `4.some-important-things/userInput.py`.

5. **Apply your knowledge**:  
   → Solve problems in `5.exam-related-prob.py/` by topic (list, string, dict, etc.).  
   → Test yourself with MCQs!

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.6+** installed.
2. Clone or download this folder.
3. Open any `.py` file in a code editor or run it directly:
   ```bash
   python 3.loop-in-buld-in-ds/loop-in-list.py
   ```
4. For markdown files (`.md`), just read them in any text editor or on GitHub.

> ✅ **Pro Tip**: Don’t just read—**edit the code**, break it, fix it, and add your own examples!
